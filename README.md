Title: *Gnosis y la Teologia Politica* (Gnosticism and political theology)
Author: Giuseppe Gennarini

Age: 15+

Summary:

This book includes some lessons taught at the Blessed Luis de San Vitores Theological Institute, on the island of Guam. Gennarini leads us in these pages through hundreds of years of history in which political power has faced the papacy and the Church, showing how, contrary to what many believe and defend, the latter has fought with nails and teeth to maintain its autonomy against the first. As central threads that weave the canvas of this work, there is the mutation and adaptation of one of the most multifaceted heresies in the history of the Church: gnosis. And on the other hand, the tensions between the empire and the papacy that led to the flowering of a large number of Christological heresies for purely political reasons. While leading us through the mutations of gnosis to this day, Gennarini introduces us to some ideas of Political Theology, showing how the temporal power of the empire or empires is hidden behind every heresy treated here. These, according to Gennarini, have found in the heresies that denied the transcendence and divinity of the body of Christ, of his Church, a kind ally that allowed them again the deification of temporal power. Judeo-Christian monotheism and especially the Passion and Resurrection of Christ demystifies pagan religions by showing the violence that is hidden behind them and the humanity of emperors and kings. Christianity is presented in this way as a radical revolution, which frees man from the violence of ancient religions and from submission to the powers of this world. Through absolute non-violence, submission and the cross, the human being becomes truly free in the image and likeness of its creator. A book that will open our eyes in history that we know about surprising parameters, a universal vision to understand much better the problems that society presents in our day.

Notes:

There's mention and talk of gender ideology in the view of the Chruch. These can be classified as mature themes as seen when the author uses real life cases. There's no swearing so that's a plus. It's a mostly historical book.
